<h1>Welcome to VirusBreak</h1>

<p>
    This game allows you to see how viral outbreaks spread through a population
    you can watch the spread of well known viruses such as measles or ebola, or 
    make up your own.
</p>

<p>
    As well as looking at the spread of your infection you can also play with
    counter-measures such as quarantine and vaccination to slow or even stop 
    the spread of the disease.  You can see how these measures can be effective
    in stopping even the most infectious diseases, and how losing these controls
    can allow disease to re-emerge.
